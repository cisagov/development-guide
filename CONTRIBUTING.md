# Welcome #

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to this open source
project!  If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit
the issue or pull request anyway.  The worst that can happen is that
you'll be politely asked to change something.  We appreciate any sort
of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of
that.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read our CONTRIBUTING policy
(you are here), our [LICENSE](LICENSE), and our [README](README.md),
all of which should be in this repository.

## Issues ##

If you want to report a bug or request a new feature, the most direct
method is to [create an
issue](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/issues) in this
repository.  We recommend that you first search through existing
issues (both open and closed) to check if your particular issue has
already been reported.  If it has then you might want to add a comment
to the existing issue.  If it hasn't then feel free to create a new
one.

## Pull requests ##

If you choose to [submit a pull
request](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/pulls), you will
notice that our continuous integration (CI) system runs a fairly
extensive set of linters and syntax checkers.  Your pull request may
fail these checks, and that's OK.  If you want you can stop there and
wait for us to make the necessary corrections to ensure your code
passes the CI checks.

If you want to make the changes yourself, or if you want to become a
regular contributor, then you will want to set up
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) on your local machine.  Once you
do that, the CI checks will run locally before you even write your
commit message.  This speeds up your development cycle considerably.

### Setting up pre-commit ###

There are a few ways to do this, but we prefer to use
[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and
[`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) to
create and manage a Python virtual environment specific to this
project.

We recommend using the `setup-env` script located in this repository,
as it automates the entire environment configuration process. The
dependencies required to run this script are
[GNU `getopt`](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/blob/master/misc-utils/getopt.1.adoc),
[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), and [`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv).
If these tools are already configured on your system, you can simply run the
following command:

```console
./setup-env
```

Otherwise, follow the steps below to manually configure your
environment.

#### Installing and using GNU `getopt`, `pyenv`, and `pyenv-virtualenv` ####

On macOS, we recommend installing [brew](https://brew.sh/).  Then
installation is as simple as `brew install gnu-getopt pyenv pyenv-virtualenv` and
adding this to your profile:

```bash
# GNU getopt must be explicitly added to the path since it is
# keg-only (https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#what-does-keg-only-mean)
export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/gnu-getopt/bin:$PATH"

# Setup pyenv
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

For Linux, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), or macOS (if you
don't want to use `brew`) you can use
[pyenv/pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) to
install the necessary tools. Before running this ensure that you have
installed the prerequisites for your platform according to the
[`pyenv` wiki
page](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/common-build-problems).
GNU `getopt` is included in most Linux distributions as part of the
[`util-linux`](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux) package.

On WSL you should treat your platform as whatever Linux distribution
you've chosen to install.

Once you have installed `pyenv` you will need to add the following
lines to your `.bash_profile` (or `.profile`):

```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
```

and then add the following lines to your `.bashrc`:

```bash
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

If you want more information about setting up `pyenv` once installed, please run

```console
pyenv init
```

and

```console
pyenv virtualenv-init
```

for the current configuration instructions.

If you are using a shell other than `bash` you should follow the
instructions that the `pyenv-installer` script outputs.

You will need to reload your shell for these changes to take effect so
you can begin to use `pyenv`.

For a list of Python versions that are already installed and ready to
use with `pyenv`, use the command `pyenv versions`.  To see a list of
the Python versions available to be installed and used with `pyenv`
use the command `pyenv install --list`.  You can read more
[here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md) about
the many things that `pyenv` can do.  See
[here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv#usage) for the
additional capabilities that pyenv-virtualenv adds to the `pyenv`
command.

#### Creating the Python virtual environment ####

Once `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` are installed on your system, you
can create and configure the Python virtual environment with these
commands:

```console
cd development-guide
pyenv virtualenv <python_version_to_use> development-guide
pyenv local development-guide
pip install --requirement requirements-dev.txt
```

#### Installing the pre-commit hook ####

Now setting up pre-commit is as simple as:

```console
pre-commit install
```

At this point the pre-commit checks will run against any files that
you attempt to commit.  If you want to run the checks against the
entire repo, just execute `pre-commit run --all-files`.

## Quality assurance and code reviews ##

In order to maintain standardization of practices, ensure security standards
are being met, and to incorporate third party code as seamlessly as possible,
all submitted code will go through our quality assurance (QA) team.

Code contributors are able to coordinate with the QA team at any point during
the contribution process. We recommend initiating the discussions as early as
possible, to decrease the likelihood of issues around merging or using the
contributed code occurring late in the process. However, the QA team is not
responsible for the success of the project or for ensuring that all team
members follow the development standards which have been established. Any
discussions or initial inputs are a courtesy evaluation, and contributing teams
remain responsible for the quality of their code, internal coordination, and
alignment with the standards set forth in this guide.

The type of contribution being made (e.g. typo corrections vs. a new repository),
complexity of code change (e.g. adding a new test vs. adding a new function), and
the testability of the code (e.g. well-documented and replicable) will factor
into the level of interaction needed with the QA team.
